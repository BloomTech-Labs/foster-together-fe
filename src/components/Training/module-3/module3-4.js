              When we do distinguish, we call [kids born to us] “bio” kids, not

              “foster kids,” say “children in foster care.” Other ideas: “kids
              who were already at home with you,” and use first names whenever
              possible, to avoid reinforcing insecurities.]

              Having a new child in the home is a big adjustment as parents may
              feel consumed with visits, therapy appointments, and providing the
              new child with attention and nurturing in order to best meet their
              higher level of needs. Other children in the home will benefit
              from your attention and desire to do fun things with them. Simple
              implementation: When you enter the home, make sure to greet each
              of the children with the same level of enthusiasm and interest.

            My Foster Children Have Too Many Toys— but let me tell you what they
            do need

        <Text>
          Many children who come into foster care may be overly clingy and lack
          appropriate boundaries. It’s easy to want to cuddle and coddle them
          and shower them with attention and affection to help heal their pain.
          However, [sometimes this is a sign that he or she has] made so many
          transitions they are confused as to who is “their person” and may seek
          the attention of any adult willing to give affection, which can be
          quite dangerous. Many of our friends will experience a foster child
          climbing up onto their laps and refuse to get down, and believe “Oh we
          have such a special bond! She loves me!” But the truth is the child
          likely does that to every single stranger we pass.

            We can’t undo (sometimes years of) neglect by giving excessive
            attention now. Hurting children need affection, no doubt, but they
            also need to learn boundaries, and to be guided toward forming safe
            connections and trust with their new caretaker first.{' '}
