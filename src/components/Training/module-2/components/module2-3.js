  `I am flexible on the day of the week I drop off, and so is she! With the first kids she fostered, there was one day a week in which she spent most of the day in meetings with the kids' families, so she didn't have much time to cook. So while she had those kids, I made a point of dropping off the same day each week. Now with a new set of siblings, she doesn't have the same restriction on her schedule, so I drop off when it works for me.`,
  `If I don't have time to cook something elaborate, I put in all the components for an easy & kid-friendly dinner. Last week, for example, I gave her the ingredients for naan bread pizzas, along with a salad and several other items.`,
  'Consider what mealtime would be most helpful for the family. Dinner is always the first thought, but would breakfast be more helpful, as the foster parent is rushing to get kids to school on time?',
  `I keep track of the foods I drop off to avoid too much repetition and make notes if there's something in particular that a certain kid or parent likes/dislikes.`,
  'Find out the best method of communication for the foster parent (phone, text, email, IM, etc.). I think for the first few weeks, she and I were emailing until we both realized that neither of us check our email regularly, then we switched to text for most of it.',
  'Friendly gestures are always a bonus. Some Family Helpers write short notes of gratitude and solidarity to the foster parents. Others text an encouraging message every few weeks. When many foster parents feel isolated, being thoughtful goes a long way.',
  `Consider the family’s desires and needs, then find the best option to fit your schedule.`,
  'Offer specific drop-off times to choose from (“Tuesday at 6, Thursday at 4, or Sunday at noon?”). This is better than an open-ended question, (“Is there a good day for me to bring a meal?”) which can lead to a slower process.',
  'When foster parents go on to adopt, they can use support through that process, too.',
