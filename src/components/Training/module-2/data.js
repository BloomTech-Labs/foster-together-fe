Therefore, in addition to meals, specific helping tasks may include errands, housework, homework in a family setting, or supervising playtime while the parent is home. As the parent-helper relationship develops and trust is warranted, more interaction with the children may be helpful (driving, babysitting, respite), as approval by county or agency is granted. Keep in mind, though, the Family Helper’s primary job is not to develop a relationship with the child, become a mentor, or show special attention. In other words, you are a warm presence and practical help for the whole family, and not a "special friend" to the kids (you'll see specific examples and more explanations in Module Three).`,
