                <p>
                  We perform a basic Colorado Arrest Records check before each
                  match. Foster Together defers to foster parents whether to
                  reveal their home address after the initial meeting with the
                  helping family. In the case of Foster Family Helpers who
                  desire to do more with families (babysitting, driving, etc),
                  Foster Together{" "}
                  <span>defers to the licensing county or agency</span>, as
                  background check and training requirements differ across
                  institutions.

              <h3>Option One: Casual Helping</h3>
              <p>
                While there is no legal requirement for a background check or
                training for casual contact with a foster family (i.e. dropping
                off meals, meeting at the park with the foster parents and
                kids), we do run a Colorado Arrest Records check as a buffer.

              <p>
                <span>
                  As a Foster Family Helper, you are developing a natural
                  relationship with the family, and are allowed to help out as
                  any other friend or neighbor would.

              </p>
              <p>
                As a best practice, Foster Together Colorado seeks to deter
                predators from our matching program by educating families in
                sexual abuse prevention, red flags for predatory grooming, and
                body safety rules (more info in the next section). We know that
                talking openly about prevention with adults in the child’s life
                is the best way to keep kids safe.

                  As with any family connections, foster parents have the
                  responsibility to be aware and cautious as all parties earn
                  trust.

              kids. Foster Together is willing to help with this process. Foster
              Family Helpers are encouraged to pay for their own background
              checks, but Foster Together is willing to subsidize these costs if
              needed.
