                Because one in three girls and one in four boys will be targets
                for sexual abuse, we can't leave this part out.

              <p>
                Because kids in foster care are one of the groups most at-risk
                to be abused, we can't afford not to prepare every Foster Family
                Helper to prevent abuse.

                The main point is that secrets and wrong motivations can't exist
                in the light of open communication and savvy supervision. So if
                you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about. We
                also know that the most effective way to prevent predators from
                targeting our kids is by setting the expectation for all adults
                involved that private parts are off limits and secrets are a
                no-go. As a foster care volunteer opportunity, we realize that
                someone who wants to gain access to children might see Foster
                Together as an easy target.{" "}

            <span>Excerpt: Pay attention to our behaviors.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            People who sexually abuse children methodically groom to gain
            access—and then compliance.
          </p>
          <p style={{ margin: "30px" }}>
            <i>
              “The kids I abused were all seeking love. I would shower the child
              with gifts, special treatment and attention, and painstakingly
              move toward the moment when I could gain compliance and cross the
              line.”
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            In some instances, the parent is also being groomed through a level
            of generosity that is probably too good to be true – free
            babysitting, financial support, and perhaps an excessive willingness
            to “help out.” There is good news. With knowledge, you can recognize
            grooming behaviors and with courage, you can speak up.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Lesson:</span> Pay attention to these kinds of behaviors and
            patterns: favoring children, special treatment, allowing kids to
            break rules, gift-giving, lots of attention, a listening ear, taking
            a child’s side, manipulation, introducing kids to sexual material,
            or talking about sex (i.e., sexualizing the relationship). Read the
