Therefore, in addition to meals, specific helping tasks may include errands, housework, homework in a family setting, or supervising playtime while the parent is home. As the parent-helper relationship develops and trust is warranted, more interaction with the children may be helpful (driving, babysitting, respite), as approval by county or agency is granted. Keep in mind, though, the Family Helper’s primary job is not to develop a relationship with the child, become a mentor, or show special attention. In other words, you are a warm presence and practical help for the whole family, and not a "special friend" to the kids (you'll see specific examples and more explanations in Module Three).`,

                        Foster Together starts all matches with the Family
                        Helper dropping off a meal once a month. You may like to
                        expand your responsibilities over the coming weeks or
                        months, and each foster family communicates with us
                        about a variety of needs in the home--not just meals.
                        Before you commit to more, we encourage you to establish
                        a rhythm with only one task (meal drop-off) within your
                        time/money budget before adding more.

                    In the past, some Helpers have jumped in enthusiastically
                    (for example, creating ten freezer meals per month), then
                    felt awkward when they had to cut back due to the grocery
                    budget or time demands. You can always add tasks, but it's
                    best not to over commit.
