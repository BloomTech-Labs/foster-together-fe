              P.S. For those who want to do even more to help kids: For Foster
              Together to recruit and train our average volunteer, it costs us
              $200. That's pretty good when you consider the long term
              friendships we're providing to foster families. If you'd like to
              help us cover the costs for the next volunteer, please join our
              donor team!
