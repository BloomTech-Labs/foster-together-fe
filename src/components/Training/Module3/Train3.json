{"Title": "WHAT'S YOUR VISION OF A FOSTER FAMILY?",
"ParagraphOne": "Helpers are often surprised when they meet their foster parent match. As humans, we tend to make assumptions about what a “type” might look like, and it’s best when we leave room to be pleasantly surprised by reality. For example, here are a few of the massive variations in foster families:",
"Paragraphs": ["They don’t feel like they possess a super-human strength. They feel pretty average, just as most parents do at the end of a long day. Personality types can influence anyone’s affect and energy level.", "Very few foster parents have medical or professional therapeutic training for their care of kids with high special needs (everything from complex trauma to feeding tubes), and those who do are paid a living wage for this full-time care. Most foster homes simply receive the average $13 daily reimbursement for the child's food, transportation, childcare, and special activities.", "They make various levels of income. Some foster families are single parent homes where the parent works full time, others are dual-income, and others have an at-home parent while partner’s job provides financially. Due to income differences, some drive 15 year old minivans, others drive a sportscar. As far as we can tell, every foster family we’ve worked with, regardless of the size of house or price of car, has clear and honorable intentions to help kids, and that’s what matters to us. We want to provide that extra friendship (that money can't buy) and practical support to any families willing to help kids heal." , "They might be married, single, living with parents or grown kids, elderly, or LGBT." ]
