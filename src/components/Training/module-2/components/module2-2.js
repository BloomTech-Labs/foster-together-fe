                  Before offering specific details on meal drop-off at the first
                  meeting, the Helper already has an idea of what would work
                  well for his or her schedule and budget (see questionnaire
                  below).

                      Foster Together starts all matches with the Family Helper
                      dropping off a meal once a month. You may like to expand
                      your responsibilities over the coming weeks or months, and
                      each foster family communicates with us about a variety of
                      needs in the home--not just meals. Before you commit to
                      more, we encourage you to establish a rhythm with only one
                      task (meal drop-off) within your time/money budget before
                      adding more.

                    <p>
                      In the past, some Helpers have jumped in enthusiastically
                      (for example, creating ten freezer meals per month), then
                      felt awkward when they had to cut back due to the grocery
                      budget or time demands. You can always add tasks, but it's
                      best not to over commit.

                  The Family Helper’s main job is to give the foster parent
                  additional capacity (time, emotional energy, physical energy,
                  encouragement) to remain emotionally present with the
                  child(ren). Therefore, in addition to meals, specific helping
                  tasks may include errands, housework, homework in a family
                  setting, or supervising playtime while the parent is home. As
                  the parent-helper relationship develops and trust is
                  warranted, more interaction with the children may be helpful
                  (driving, babysitting, respite), as approval by county or
                  agency is granted. Keep in mind, though, the Family Helper’s
                  primary job is not to develop a relationship with the child,
                  become a mentor, or show special attention. In other words,
                  you are a warm presence and practical help for the whole
                  family, and not a "special friend" to the kids (you'll see
                  specific examples and more explanations in Module Three).{" "}

                  Let the relationship benefit others naturally, as far as both
                  parties are comfortable. Does the Helper have a friend who
                  would like to deliver a meal? Does the Foster Parent know a
                  fellow foster parent who needs help? Open communication and
                  idea-sharing can make the best kinds of neighborly connection.{" "}
