    "title": "Dear Foster Neighbor",
    "p1": "As one of our first matches, you are about to be living proof that foster care isn't just a sterile system, but a community of good people making sure a kid gets what he or sheneeds.",
    "p2": "With your friendly support, we will increase the healing power of the entire home, creating more stability for kids.",
    "p3": "In a system so confusing and demanding as child welfare, the humanity and customization of a match like yours is where the magic happens.",
    "p4": "While good neighbors want to do something simple to help a foster family, most people in Colorado donâ€™t know a foster parent.We're fixing this by matching helpers with foster families within 10 miles of each other, with the simple commitment of dropping off a meal once a month (and freedom, but not obligation, to do more).",
    "p5": " All four modules of this training should take under two hours to read and complete."
