                  When a specific family in your area, or a family you meet at a
                  Neighborhood Party, is ready for help, Foster Together will
                  email or call you with a basic overview of the family. If you
                  agree, we'll help you exchange info and meet up.

              Drop the foster parents a line every few weeks to make sure your
              meals are received. Ask how the family enjoys the food, and be
              genuinely open to specific requests or changes, within reason.

              If desired and fitting into your time/money budget, you and the
              foster family are free to develop a relationship beyond meal
              drop-off, always with the oversight of the family’s county or
              agency (for childcare or transportation).
