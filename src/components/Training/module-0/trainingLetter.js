        As one of our first matches, you are about to be living proof that
        foster care isn’t just a sterile system, but a community of good people
        making sure a kid gets what he or she needs.

        With your friendly support, we will increase the healing power of the
        entire home,<b> creating more stability for kids.</b>
      </LetterText>
      <LetterText>
        In a system so confusing and demanding as child welfare, the humanity
        and customization of a match like yours is where the magic happens.

        While good neighbors want to do something simple to help a foster
        family, most people in Colorado don’t know a foster parent. We're fixing
        this by matching helpers with foster families within 10 miles of each
        other{" "}

          with the simple commitment of dropping off a meal once a month (and
          freedom, but not obligation, to do more).

          answering the questions you may not know to ask yet.

        This is what makes a Family Helper match last for a long time, rather
        than quickly fizzling out.

        matched!
