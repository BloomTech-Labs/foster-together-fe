## Project Overview

- [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/HhPz69no/foster-together)
- [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Foster-Together-f7ff4ab169724a83a9eec6500829ec18)
- [UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/NRkSfUIkcMXwxkVVNtH97P/Foster-Together-Marc-%26-Frantz?node-id=582%3A95597)

Foster Together is a nonprofit organization that connects foster families to volunteers (or "neighbors") in their area that can help with various tasks like cooking and transportation.

The main problem that the organization faces: data is scattered into multiple emails and spreadsheets, making it difficult to keep track of neighbors and foster family information.

Our goal with this application is to streamline the process for volunteer and family sign up, make it easier for the admins to view and interact with data, and automate the matching process.

From the [Foster Together](https://www.fostertogether.co/) website:

> In general, two myths persist about foster parents. Either they're "doing it for the money" (sometimes true, but not the norm) or they're a special, heroic kind of person with time and a big heart to spare. Through a public relations campaign based on real life foster parents, Foster Together will introduce you to "someone like you" who makes foster care work, with the right motivations and support from neighbors.

> When tragedy strikes, local communities jump in with tangible relief efforts. Foster care exists as disaster relief in the most tragic of life events for a child. Through Random Acts of Foster Kindness, we connect neighbors with foster parents to meet a simple need like a delicious feast delivered at dinnertime, or transportation for a child's therapy appointments. We make it easy. We make it fast. We make it relational.

### Key Features

- Registration process for families and neighbors
- Dashboard for admins to view and interact with database
- Integration with Checkr for background checks

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### [React](https://reactjs.org/)

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

#### [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more. Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.

#### [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

Utilizing tagged template literals and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles.

#### [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/)

Formik takes care of the repetitive and annoying stuff--keeping track of values/errors/visited fields, orchestrating validation, and handling submission--so you don't have to. This means you spend less time wiring up state and change handlers and more time focusing on your business logic.

#### [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.

#### Front end deployed to [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)

### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/foster-together-be) built using:

#### [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

#### [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

#### [Knex](http://knexjs.org/)

Knex.js is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for Postgres, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use. It features both traditional node style callbacks as well as a promise interface for cleaner async flow control, a stream interface, full featured query and schema builders, transaction support (with savepoints), connection pooling and standardized responses between different query clients and dialects.

#### [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

# APIs

#### [Checkr](https://checkr.com/) (coming soon)

Checkr is a modern, RESTful API-driven background screening service. The Checkr API uses resource-oriented URLs, supports HTTPS authentication and HTTPS verbs, and leverages JSON in all responses passed back to customers.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_API_URL - base URL for backend API (should end with /api)

# Testing

- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Supertest

# Installation Instructions

- Clone this repo
- `yarn` to install all required dependencies
- `yarn test` to start the testing environment

# Contributing

Please note we have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Issue/Bug Request

**If you are having an issue with the existing project code, please submit a bug report under the following guidelines:**

- Check first to see if your issue has already been reported.
- Check to see if the issue has recently been fixed by attempting to reproduce the issue using the latest master branch in the repository.
- Create a live example of the problem.
- Submit a detailed bug report including your environment & browser, steps to reproduce the issue, actual and expected outcomes, where you believe the issue is originating from, and any potential solutions you have considered.

### Feature Requests

We would love to hear from you about new features which would improve this app and further the aims of our project. Please provide as much detail and information as possible to show us why you think your new feature should be implemented.

### Pull Requests

If you have developed a patch, bug fix, or new feature that would improve this app, please submit a pull request. It is best to communicate your ideas with the developers first before investing a great deal of time into a pull request to ensure that it will mesh smoothly with the project.

Remember that this project is licensed under the MIT license, and by submitting a pull request, you agree that your work will be, too.

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new plist variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
- Ensure that your code conforms to our existing code conventions and test coverage.
- Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
