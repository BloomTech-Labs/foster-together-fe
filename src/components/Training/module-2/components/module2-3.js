                    (sending an extra text after drop-off) to make sure the
                    foster mom remembers to grab it from the cooler.

                I am flexible on the day of the week I drop off, and so is she!
                With the first kids she fostered, there was one day a week in
                which she spent most of the day in meetings with the kids'
                families, so she didn't have much time to cook. So while she had
                those kids, I made a point of dropping off the same day each
                week. Now with a new set of siblings, she doesn't have the same
                restriction on her schedule, so I drop off when it works for me.

            <li>
              <p>
                If I don't have time to cook something elaborate, I put in all
                the components for an easy & kid-friendly dinner. Last week, for
                example, I gave her the ingredients for naan bread pizzas, along
                with a salad and several other items.

            <li>
              <p>
                Consider what mealtime would be most helpful for the family.
                Dinner is always the first thought, but would breakfast be more
                helpful, as the foster parent is rushing to get kids to school
                on time?

                  I try to take good care of all the kids in the house- kids
                  born to the foster family, and kids in foster care, so no one
                  feels left out.

                It just so happens that she has nine year old twins, and I have
                an eleven year old daughter and a ten year old son: perfect ages
                to pass along my kids' clothes and books.

                I keep track of the foods I drop off to avoid too much
                repetition and make notes if there's something in particular
                that a certain kid or parent likes/dislikes.

                Find out the best method of communication for the foster parent
                (phone, text, email, IM, etc.). I think for the first few weeks,
                she and I were emailing until we both realized that neither of
                us check our email regularly, then we switched to text for most
                of it.

                While a well-rounded, delicious, and kid-friendly meal is the
                most requested support, you are free to get creative! Foster
                Family Helpers sometimes include a treat like fresh-baked
                cookies, the kids’ favorite fruit or veggies already sliced for
                snack time throughout the week, a loaf of fresh bread, breakfast
                burritos, or a bar of chocolate or tub of gelato as a
                post-bedtime treat for mom or dad.{" "}

                Friendly gestures are always a bonus. Some Family Helpers write
                short notes of gratitude and solidarity to the foster parents.
                Others text an encouraging message every few weeks. When many
                foster parents feel isolated, being thoughtful goes a long way.{" "}

                Offer specific drop-off times to choose from (“Tuesday at 6,
                Thursday at 4, or Sunday at noon?”). This is better than an
                open-ended question, (“Is there a good day for me to bring a
                meal?”) which can lead to a slower process.

                  When your foster family receives a new placement of a child,
                  consider asking if the child needs any additional supplies or
                  clothes. You’re welcome to collect items from friends or
                  family. For example, after her foster family welcomed two
                  little ones in November, who did not have their own coats, one
                  Helper posted a request for winter gear with the children’s
                  sizes--explaining they are in foster care and giving no
                  additional identifying information--on a local buy-sell-trade
                  group. The next week, she dropped off five bags full of
                  clothes, toys, coats, and boots along with the family’s weekly
                  meal.
